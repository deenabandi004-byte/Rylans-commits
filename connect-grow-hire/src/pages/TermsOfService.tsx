            These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding agreement between you (“you,” “User”) and
            Offerloop.ai (“Offerloop.ai,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) governing your use of our website,
            application, APIs, and related services (collectively, the “Services”). By creating an
            account, accessing, or using the Services, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy
            Policy (incorporated by reference). If you do not agree, you must not use the Services.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
          <p>
            You confirm that you are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your
            jurisdiction), legally capable of entering this agreement, not on any restricted party
            list, and permitted under applicable law to access the Services. The Services are not
            directed to children under 13 (or 16 where a higher threshold applies).
          </p>

          <h2>2. Account Registration &amp; Security</h2>
          <p>
            You must provide accurate, up-to-date information when creating an account and maintain
            it. You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure and for all activity
            on your account. Notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:support@offerloop.ai">support@offerloop.ai</a> if you suspect
            unauthorized access. We may refuse, reclaim, or remove usernames at our discretion.

          <h2>3. Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>

          <p><strong>Changes:</strong> We may adjust plan pricing or features prospectively with notice (email or in-app). Continuing to use the Services after changes take effect means you accept them.</p>
          <p><strong>Upgrades/Downgrades:</strong> Upgrades may bill immediately on a prorated basis; downgrades apply at the next renewal.</p>
          <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> Except where required by law, payments are non-refundable.</p>
          <p><strong>Taxes:</strong> You are responsible for applicable taxes, though we may collect and remit when legally required.</p>

            limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Services for

            “User Content” includes resumes, text, email templates, contact notes, performance
            metrics, and other material you provide or generate through the Services. You retain
            ownership of your content. By using the Services, you grant Offerloop.ai a worldwide,

            comply with legal obligations, and (iii) enforce these Terms. You represent that you
            have the necessary rights to your User Content and that it does not infringe any laws or
            third-party rights.
          </p>

          </ul>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to throttle, filter, suspend, or terminate accounts that appear
            abusive.

          <h2>7. AI &amp; Automated Features</h2>
          <p>
            The Services may incorporate AI (e.g., OpenAI) to generate personalized content,
            analytics, or explanations. Outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or non-compliant. You
            are responsible for reviewing AI-generated suggestions before using them. Offerloop.ai
            disclaims liability for actions you take based on AI outputs.

            information may include names, job titles, company details, and professional contact
            information. Use of this data is limited to enabling networking, recruiting automation,

            <li>We do not use Google data to train generalized AI/ML models.</li>
            <li>

          </p>

          <h2>25. Governing Law &amp; Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Delaware (excluding conflict rules).</p>

          <p><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You may opt out of arbitration (but not the class waiver) by emailing <a href="mailto:support@offerloop.ai">support@offerloop.ai</a> within 30 days of first acceptance, stating your name and account email.</p>

          <h2>26. Export &amp; Sanctions Compliance</h2>
          <p>
            You represent you are not located in or a resident of a country under U.S. embargo and

          <p>
            We are not responsible for delays or failures caused by circumstances beyond our control,

          </p>

          <h2>28. Assignment</h2>
          <p>
            You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign them
            freely (e.g., through merger, acquisition, or reorganization).
          </p>

          <h2>29. Severability</h2>
          <p>
            If any provision is held invalid, the rest remain in effect. A valid term will replace
            the invalid one to best reflect original intent.
          </p>

          <h2>30. Waiver</h2>
          <p>
            Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of future enforcement. No waiver is
